              Introduction
            </h2>
            <p>
              At UIROOM, we are committed to providing high-quality services that meet the needs and expectations of our clients. While we strive for excellence, we understand that situations may arise where a refund is requested. This Refund Policy outlines our approach to handling such requests, ensuring transparency and clarity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Please carefully review our refund eligibility and process guidelines. If you have any questions or concerns about your order or service, do not hesitate to contact us.

              Refund Eligibility
            </h2>
            <p>
              Refunds are considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account various factors such as the project scope, the stage of completion, and the nature of the services provided. We assess each refund request carefully and aim to ensure that our clients are satisfied with the work delivered.
            </p>
            <p>
              In general, the following conditions apply:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li><strong>Full Refunds:</strong> Full refunds may be issued if the work has not yet started or if there was a significant issue with the delivery of our services (e.g., the project is abandoned before completion).</li>
              <li><strong>Partial Refunds:</strong> Partial refunds may be provided if the project is partially completed and the client is not satisfied with the progress made.</li>
              <li><strong>No Refunds:</strong> Once the project is completed and delivered, no refunds will be issued unless a clear breach of contract or failure to deliver as promised has occurred.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each refund request will be reviewed individually, and we will communicate with you to ensure that your concerns are properly addressed.

              Non-Refundable Services
            </h2>
            <p>
              Certain services are non-refundable, including but not limited to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
              <li>Services rendered in full or partially completed work that has already been delivered to the client.</li>
              <li>Digital products (e.g., eBooks, downloadable resources) once accessed or downloaded.</li>
              <li>Custom projects that have been started or completed according to the clientâ€™s specifications, where no material failure or breach of contract is involved.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We encourage clients to thoroughly review all project details before starting, as non-refundable services cannot be returned once delivered.

              While we strive to be fair and transparent with our refund policy, there may be special cases where exceptions are made.
